# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website repository hosted on GitHub Pages at dustinniles.github.io. The project is in its initial setup phase.

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal - the project structure has not yet been established. This is a GitHub Pages repository, which typically supports:
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites
- Jekyll-based sites (Ruby)
- Modern static site generators (Hugo, Next.js, Gatsby, etc.)

## Development Workflow

The project structure and tooling will be determined based on the chosen static site approach. Once established, this section should be updated with:
- Build commands
- Local development server commands
- Deployment process (GitHub Pages typically auto-deploys from the main branch or gh-pages branch)

## GitHub Pages Notes

- Repository name format (username.github.io) indicates this is a User Pages site
- Will be published at https://dustinniles.github.io
- GitHub Actions can be used for custom build workflows if needed
- Default branch deployments or gh-pages branch are common patterns
